# Support for mozilla/node-convict
You may wonder what `config-schema.json` is. We have a convention to store a
JSON structure with all configuration options of our application in the
repository, for this we use the format of [Mozilla convict](https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict).

This subpackage parses this format.
